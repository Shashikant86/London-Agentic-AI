# London Agentic AI: Demos

Welcome to the official source code repository for the [London Agentic AI Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/london-agentic-ai/)! This repository hosts all the code, demos, and projects shared during our meetup sessions.

## About London Agentic AI

London Agentic AI is a vibrant community dedicated to exploring, learning, and brainstorming ideas to build safe, reliable, and production-grade AI agents with the community in London and beyond. Founded in April 2025, our meetup brings together AI engineers, agent builders, ML researchers, and data scientists who are passionate about autonomous systems and cutting-edge AI technologies. Our goal is knowledge sharing and learning as a community. 

### Our Mission

**"To explore, learn, and share best practices of Agentic AI"**

We focus on practical, builder-oriented discussions and hands-on exploration of agent technologies, maintaining a zero-pitch policy to ensure pure knowledge exchange within our inclusive community.

## Focus Areas

Our meetups cover a wide range of topics in the agentic AI space:

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Building and orchestrating multiple AI agents
- **Agent Orchestration**: Frameworks and patterns for agent coordination
- **Agentic Tools & Protocols**: Advanced protocols like MCP, A2A and techniques like Agentic RAG, prompt optimizations that foster agent development
- **Agent Frameworks**: Frameworks and methodologies for building AI agents
- **Agent Deployment**: Best practices for deploying agents in real-world scenarios
- **Agent Optimization**: Best practices for evaluating and optimizing AI agents 

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is organized by meetup sessions, with each directory containing:

- **Live coding demos** from our sessions
- **Agent Clinics**: Bring your agents to collaborate, fix, and share with others
- **Talk presentations** with accompanying code and video links
- **Community projects** and contributions
- **Framework explorations** (LangGraph, DSPy, CrewAI, etc.)

üé• **Video recordings** of talks will be available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LondonAgenticAI) and linked from each demo folder.

## Repository Structure

This is an example of the first meetup and more will be added later.

### Meetup Directory Structure

Each meetup directory follows this pattern:
- `[Number]_[Theme]/` - Main meetup folder
  - `[Speaker_Name_Topic]/` - Individual talk/demo folders
  - `README.md` - Meetup-specific information and agenda
  - `requirements.txt` or `package.json` - Dependencies (when applicable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Different demos may require different environments. Check each meetup directory for specific requirements. Common dependencies include:

- Python 3.8+ (for Python-based demos)
- Node.js 16+ (for JavaScript/TypeScript demos)
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab (for notebook demos)
- Various AI frameworks (DSPy, LangChain, LangGraph, etc.)

### Running the Code

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/London-Agentic-AI.git
   cd London-Agentic-AI
   ```

2. **Navigate to the specific meetup/demo:**
   ```bash
   cd 1_Context_Engineering/DSPy_GEPA_Mike/
   ```

3. **Follow the specific README or setup instructions** in each demo directory

4. **Install dependencies** as specified in each demo's requirements

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from our community members and external contributors! Whether you're a speaker wanting to share your demo or someone looking to improve existing code, we'd love your contributions.

Speakers can pre-upload the code as teaser (take feedback) or upload during the event or after the event. External contributors can help improving the code. 

- **Speakers**: Add your meetup demos and talks to the repository
- **External Contributors**: Suggest improvements, fix bugs, or enhance documentation
- **Community Members**: Help improve existing demos and share knowledge

üìù **Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to contribute.**

## Community Guidelines

- **Be Respectful**: Foster an inclusive environment for all community members
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Focus on learning and sharing, not pitching products
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide helpful and constructive feedback on demos and projects
- **Safety First**: Always prioritize safe and responsible AI development practices

## Meetup Sessions
